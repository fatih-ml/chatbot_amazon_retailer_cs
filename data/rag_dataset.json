Learn how to sell—whether you’re new to online retail or just new to selling in the Amazon store.\n\nWelcome to Amazon selling—where customer obsession is key\n\nAmazon is one of the most trusted brands in the US. We work hard to provide every customer with what they need when they need it—and we’re excited every time a new seller joins our community and starts providing Amazon customers with an even wider selection of products.

You can also use tools in Seller Central to create promotions and coupons, track payments and expenses, and much more. Consider adding other users to your account if you’d like help with certain tasks.\n---\nBefore you start selling, you’ll want to configure your Seller Central account for your business. Make sure you review, confirm, or adjust the following, as needed:\n\nPublic seller profile\n\nPayment and business information\n\nShipping and returns settings\n\nTax information and settings\n\nNotification preferences\n\nLogin settings\n\nUser permissions\n\nGo mobile\n\nUse the free Amazon Seller app\n\nThe Amazon Seller app is packed with features to help you manage and grow your ecommerce business wherever you are. It gives you the freedom to take care of business details right from your phone or tablet. Learn more about the Amazon Seller app\n\nEnroll your brand\n\nIf you’re the rights owner for an eligible brand, we recommend enrolling it in Amazon Brand Registry before you list your products. That makes it easier to associate your products with your brand name. Brand Registry is free and provides sellers with a suite of additional selling benefits and protection tools.\n\nAfter enrolling your brand:\n\nYou’ll have greater control over the information on your product detail pages.\n\nYou’ll be able to access no-cost tools like A+ Content, Stores, Manage Your Experiments, and Brand Analytics, which can help you grow your audience and increase sales.\n---\n# You’ll enjoy automated protections for your brand and access to additional reporting options.\n\nEnroll your brand in Amazon Brand Registry\n\nDon't have an Amazon seller account yet? Sign up\n\nList products\n\nUnderstand the product detail page\n\nIf you’ve shopped in the Amazon store, you’ll recognize the product detail page. It’s where customers find all relevant information about an item.\n\nWhen multiple sellers offer the same product, Amazon combines their offers on one product detail page to make it easier for customers to find, compare, and purchase items.\n\nLearn how to boost your listings and drive sales\n---\n# Images\n\n500 x 500 or 1,000 x 1,000 pixels to increase listing quality\n\n# Variations\n\nSuch as different colors, scents, or sizes\n\n# Bullet points\n\nShort, descriptive sentences highlighting key features and benefits\n\nVideo 8:25\n\nIntro to product detail\n\n# Featured offer (\"Buy Box\")\n\nThe featured offer on a detail page.

Products offered for sale in the Amazon store must comply with all laws and regulations, as well as Amazon policies. Before you start the listing process, make sure your understand our Product safety and Restricted products policies.\n\n# Find or obtain a product ID (GTIN)\n\nThe primary tool we use to pair a seller’s offer with the correct product detail page is a product ID, also called a Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). It can often be found on packaging above or below the product’s barcode. The most common GTIN used by Amazon sellers is a UPC, but you might also find an ISBN, EAN, or JAN on your product.\n\nIn some cases, you might need to obtain a GTIN for a product from Global Standards. In rare cases, you might apply for a GTIN exemption from Amazon.\n\n# Match or create a product listing\n\nIf the product you want to sell is already in the Amazon store, you can use its GTIN to match an offer to the existing product detail page. If a product isn’t already in the Amazon store, you’ll need to create a new product detail page and can add your offer information simultaneously.\n\nAll sellers can match or create product listings one at a time. Professional sellers can also match or create product listings in bulk.\n\nYour ability to list a product in the Amazon store can depend on its category, condition, and brand. In some cases, you’ll need to apply to sell a product, category, or brand. You’ll be prompted to do so during the listing process.\n\nVideo 7:51\n\nIntro to listing products in the Amazon store\n\nLearn what you need before you list products and how to match offers and create product detail pages both one at a time and in bulk.\n\n# Listing: product categories and conditions\n---\n# Product categories\n\n|Product category|Categories without restrictions|\n|---|---|\n|Amazon Device Accessories|Amazon devices accessories|\n|Amazon Kindle|Kindle devices accessories|\n|Beauty|Fragrance, skincare, makeup, hair care, bath & shower (topicals require approval).

They may be prompted to complete a brand selling application first.\n\nAmazon jargon: ASIN\n\nEvery product in the Amazon store is automatically assigned an ASIN, or Amazon Standard Identification Number. This number is different from a GTIN and SKU. If you don’t have a GTIN for a product, you can try to match an offer to an existing product detail page using its ASIN instead.\n\nDon't have an Amazon seller account yet?\n\nSign up\n\nPrice products\n\nBefore you set prices for your products, you’ll want to get familiar with key concepts we use to organize and support pricing in the Amazon store.\n\n- Competitive external price: the lowest price for an item from major retailers outside Amazon. We share competitive external prices with sellers. For your own price to be considered competitive, your standard item price, plus shipping, must be less than or equal to the competitive external price.\n- Featured Offer: the offer a customer often sees near the top of a product detail page with ‘Buy Now’ and ‘Add to Cart’ buttons. To compete for the Featured Offer, a seller must set a competitive price and have a Professional selling plan. The product also needs to be in new condition.\n- Lowest Amazon price: the lowest price currently offered by a seller in the Amazon store. We share the current lowest Amazon price to give sellers who list a product the opportunity to match or beat it.\n\nWant to optimize your prices? Learn how the Automate pricing tool can help you become the Featured Offer for a product in the Amazon store.\n---\n# Video 11:07\n\nIntro to pricing products in the Amazon store\n\nFind out what a competitive price, lowest price, and Featured Offer are. Get an overview of how sellers set static prices and apply dynamic pricing rules to their products.\n\n# Select your fulfillment method\n\nYou have two basic options for getting customers their stuff:\n\n1. You can fulfill orders yourself, maintaining your own inventory and shipping products directly to customers. We call pis merchant-fulfilled shipping (MFN).\n2. You can send your inventory to Amazon and have us pick, pack, and deliver products prough Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). FBA also takes care of customer service and returns.\n\nEach method has its own benefits—and you can decide which one is right for each product you sell. If you’re a current seller, you can also use our Revenue Calculator to compare estimates for FBA and your own fulfillment method.\n\n# Considering FBA?\n\nFind out if the program is worth it for your business\n\n# Video 6:27\n\nIntroduction on How to Ship Products on Your Own\n\nIn this video you will get an overview on merchant fulfilled shipping, guidelines on packaging, understand your shipping / cancellation metrics, guidelines to maintain positive customer experience.\n\n# Video 5:12\n\nHow Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) works\n\nLearn how to use Amazon FBA to offer Prime shipping to your customers and have Amazon pick, pack, and ship orders on your behalf. In this video, you’ll learn how FBA works and where to access additional FBA tools and resources.\n---\n# Monitor your performance\n\nTo sell in the Amazon store, you’re required to comply with all applicable laws and Amazon policies. Our Account Health dashboard provides an overview of your account’s adherence to policies and various performance targets.\n\n# Customer Service Performance\n\nYour customer-service performance is measured using what we call an Order Defect Rate (ODR). Your ODR is the percentage of your orders with one or more indicators of poor customer service. That could be negative customer feedback or a credit-card chargeback. We require sellers to maintain an ODR under 1%.\n\nLooking for help with customer service?

To maintain a ‘Good’ rating, make sure to address any policy violations listed on your Account Health dashboard. If your rating is ‘At Risk’ or ‘Critical’, your account may be at risk of deactivation.\n\n# Shipping Performance\n\nYou can use three metrics to help assess the health of your MFN shipping performance:\n\nYour Late Shipment Rate (LSR) is pe percentage of your seller-fulfilled orders pat have a shipping confirmation after peir expected shipping date. You should aim to keep it below 4%.\nYour Pre-fulfillment Cancel Rate (CR) is pe percentage of seller-fulfilled orders you cancel. You should aim to keep it below 2.5%.\n---\nYour Valid Tracking Rate (VTR) is the percentage of packages from your seller-fulfilled orders with a valid tracking number.

If you leave auto-replenishment enabled, your products are considered in stock and buyable when they're received by Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD), and we manage your replenishments so you don't have to worry about Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) capacity limits.\n\nNote: the promised delivery dates for products stored with AWD, or products in transit from AWD to the Amazon fulfillment network, will differ from delivery dates for products that are already in the fulfillment network.\n\n|Simplify your|supply chain and|stay in stock|\n|---|---|---|\n|Use a fully automated set of supply chain services to get| | |\n|your products from manufacturers to customers around| | |\n|the world.| | |\n|Get started| | |\n\nHome        Programs        Supply Chain by Amazon\n\nEnglish              United States            Feedback\n\nSell with Amazon                  Selling Programs                     Amazon for Brands                       Resources                          Tools\n\nSell online                       Fulfillment by                       Online store builder                    Selling Partner Blog               Login to your seller\n\nHow to sell on                    Amazon                               Amazon Brand                            Seller University                  account\n\nAmazon                            Amazon Advertising                   Registry                                Seller Central Help                Amazon Seller App\n\nHow much does it                  Global selling                       Brand management                        Accelerate Seller                  Seller Central\n\ncost?

During enrollment, you will need to provide images that show your brand name or logo on your products or packaging.\n- You must have an active, registered trademark or a pending trademark application for your brand name or logo that’s issued by the designated government trademark office of a country with a corresponding Amazon store. In some cases, you may also enroll with a pending trademark registration. See country-specific requirements (login required).\n- You must be the trademark owner. If you are an authorized agent, have the trademark owner enroll the brand, then add you as an additional Brand Registry account user.\n- The trademark for your brand must be in the form of a text-based mark (word mark) or an image-based mark with words, letters, or numbers (design mark). Note that trademarks can have different classifications based on their issuing trademark office.\n- Your trademark text must match the brand name on your Brand Registry application. If your trademark is an image-based mark with words, letters, or numbers, you will need to upload a copy of the image during enrollment. It should match your trademark record exactly.\n- You must have the trademark registration or application number provided by the designated government office.\n- You must have a list of product categories in which your brand should be listed.\n- If you have a Seller Central or Vendor Central account, use the same username and password to create your Brand Registry account.\n\n# Do I need to create multiple Brand Registry accounts if I sell in more than one country?\n\nNo. You can create a single, global account with Brand Registry. During enrollment, you’ll only be able to select a single country-based trademark office. But you’ll be able add trademarks for the\n---\noffices of other countries after your enrollment has been approved. We recommend submitting trademarks for each country-based Amazon store you want to sell in.\n\nCan I enroll more than one brand?\n\nYes. After enrolling your first brand, you can enroll additional brands from your Brand Registry homepage by clicking Enroll a new brand.\n\nI’m trying to enroll in Amazon Brand Registry. Why am I receiving an error message?\n\nSee our list of error messages, explanations, and next steps (login required).\n\nHow do I view or edit my Brand Registry application?\n\nTo view the status of an application, visit the Brand Applications page. You can also edit an application that you haven’t yet submitted, add documents to a submitted application, or copy and correct a rejected application.\n\nLearn more about the Brand Registry application process (login required)\n\nCan I provide others with access to the Brand Registry portal?\n\nYes. After enrolling your brand in Brand Registry, you’re automatically assigned the roles of “rights owner” and “administrator.” You can invite additional users to your brand and assign them roles.\n\nLearn more about Brand Registry roles (login required)\n\nCan I add a new trademark for a brand I’ve already enrolled?\n\nYes.

For US brands with a utility patent, Brand Registry offers a neutral evaluation process within the Report a Violation tool. The Amazon Patent Evaluation Express program brings in neutral third-party evaluators who are attorneys skilled in patent analysis, to decide whether an asserted utility patent is infringed.\n\nThe process is an efficient means for utility patent owners and those accused of patent infringement to address their concerns. It is faster than the court system and is free for the party that the evaluator determines is correct.\n\nOnce a report is submitted, we notify sellers who have listings for reported products so they can participate in an evaluation and defend their claim if they choose.\n\nParticipation in an evaluation requires both parties to deposit $4,000 with the neutral evaluator. Amazon does not handle the deposit and does not retain any portion of the evaluator’s fee. The evaluator reviews submissions and determines whether the reported listings infringe the patent.\n\nAmazon follows the decision of the evaluator. The winning participant receives their $4,000 deposit\n---\n# back. If the evaluator determines the reported products infringe, Amazon removes them. If the evaluator finds in the seller’s favor, Amazon takes no action.\n\nOnce an evaluation is complete, if an application meets the criteria, utility patent owners are granted an Amazon Patent Evaluation Express ID associated with this decision. Brands can use the ID from the winning evaluation to report future infringement of that patent through Report a Violation.\n\n# What are Amazon’s policies on intellectual property and brand names?\n\nReview our Intellectual Property Policy for Sellers and the Amazon Brand Name Policy.\n\n# How can I report policy violations or other forms of abuse not related to intellectual property?\n\nYou can use the Report abuse tool to report inaccurate listing information, violations of Amazon policy, and other issues.\n\nAmazon also provides a publicly available form for reporting alleged intellectual property infringements such as copyright, trademark, and patent concerns.\n\n# Launch your brand with Amazon\n\nEnroll your brand in Amazon Brand Registry to become eligible to activate a suite of brand-building tools and protection benefits.\n\nLog in to Brand Registry\n\nNew to Brand Registry?

        "content": "# Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGet answers to the frequently asked questions about using Amazon for ecommerce.\n\n# Overview\n\nWhat is selling on Amazon?\n\nSelling on Amazon is a program that lets individuals and businesses sell their products and inventory on in Amazon's stores, like Amazon.com.\n\nWhy should I sell on Amazon?\n\nHere are just a couple of reasons: the opportunity to put your product in front of hundreds of millions of potential customers, plus the ability to start selling fast before you even set up a business website or physical store.\n\nCan I list my products in all Amazon categories?\n\nPrior approval may be required to list certain products in certain categories. Check out the Sell page for more information.\n\nWhat type of products cannot be listed on Amazon.com?\n\nSome products may not be listed as a matter of compliance with legal or regulatory restrictions (for example, prescription drugs) or Amazon policy (for example, crime scene photos). For detailed information, please see our Restricted Products Help section.\n\nWhat's the A-to-z Guarantee program?\n\nThe A-to-z Guarantee program is for situations where a customer never received a product or received a product that is materially different from what was ordered or expected. We ask customers to first contact the seller when they have a problem. If the customer isn’t satisfied after 48 hours, they can file an A-to-z claim. When Amazon receives the claim, we send the seller an email detailing the claim and requesting basic information about the order and the fulfillment process. Amazon will then determine how the claim will be settled, which may include reimbursement of the order to the customer at the seller’s expense.\n\nHow do I open a new Amazon seller account?\n\nVisit the Pricing page to sign up for the Professional plan or the Individual plan. You can use your Amazon customer account, or you can create a new account with your business email address.\n\nBefore you start, be sure to have the following information ready:\n\nYour business name, address, and contact information\nAn internationally chargeable credit card wip a valid billing address\nA phone number where you can be reached during pe registration process\nYour tax ID info\nAdditional identity documents may be required in some cases\n---\n# Can I downgrade my Professional selling account?\n\nYes. If you don’t want to be charged a monthly subscription fee, you can downgrade your account from the Professional plan to the Individual plan from the My Services page in Seller Central (login required).\n\nIf you downgrade, your account stays open and you can keep offering items on Amazon as an Individual seller, but you’ll lose access to Professional plan benefits like bulk upload, order reports, seller-customized shipping rates, or special listing features. Also, keep in mind that only offers from Professional sellers are eligible for featured offer status on product detail pages.\n\nCompare selling plans\n\n# How do I close my Amazon seller account?\n\nTo permanently close your Amazon seller account, request account closure in Seller Central. Keep in mind that you can use our Listings Status feature to suspend your product listings, or you can remove them entirely but hold on to your account for future use. Before you close your account permanently, remember to cancel and remove your listings and resolve all transactions.\n\n# How do I sell in Amazon stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico?\n\nWhen you sign up as a Professional seller, you can start selling in our US, Canadian, and Mexican stores through a North America Unified Account. This will enable you to more easily share product listing info and manage your inventory across all three stores. For all per-item transaction fees, sellers will pay the fees for the marketplace where the item was sold. If you’re a Professional seller, you’ll only be charged one monthly subscription fee for selling in North America.\n\nIf you already sell on Amazon in the US, Canada, or Mexico, you can use your existing bank account to receive disbursements in your local currency with the Amazon Currency Converter for Sellers (ACCS). If you’re a new seller registering to sell in the US, Canada, or Mexico, you can be paid directly into your local bank account in the local currency, as long as you have a bank account in a country supported by Amazon.\n\n# Pricing\n\nHow much does it cost to sell on Amazon.com?\n\nAmazon has two selling plans. The Professional selling plan costs $39.99 per month plus a per-item referral fee that varies by category. The Individual selling plan costs $0.99 per unit sold plus a per-item referral fee that varies by category. If you plan to sell fewer than 40 items a month, the Individual plan may be best for you.\n\nIn addition to the cost of your selling plan and referral fees, other costs may apply, depending on how you ship orders, whether you decide to advertise, etc.\n\nLearn more about pricing\n\nWhat are the differences between Professional and Individual accounts?\n\nThird-party sellers can sell in Amazon's stores by signing up for the Professional plan or the Individual plan. With the Individual plan, sellers pay a fee for each unit they sell. With the Professional plan, sellers pay one flat fee per month, no matter how many units they sell.\n\nLearn more about selling plans\n\nWhen do I start getting charged the monthly subscription fee?\n---\nThe monthly subscription fee applies to Professional selling accounts only and begins as soon as you finish the registration process. Your first monthly subscription fee will be charged at that time unless you’re signing up with a promotional offer.\n\nHow do I get paid?\n\nWhen your seller account is settled and you have a positive balance, Amazon sends the money to your bank account using an Automated Clearing House (ACH) or electronic funds transfer. It can take up to five business days for the money to appear in your bank account after Amazon initiates a payment.\n\nBefore we can pay you, you must provide a valid bank account as the Deposit Method in your seller account settings. We cannot make payments to a credit card or online payment system, such as PayPal.\n\nSelling\n\nHow do I manage my selling account?\n\nUse the Seller Central website to manage all parts of your Amazon business. Seller Central is the website where you manage your selling account, add product information, make inventory updates, and manage orders and payments.\n\nHow do I add inventory?\n\nYou have four options for entering product-related info:\n\n- Use the Sell on Amazon button on Amazon product pages.\n- Use the Add a Product feature on Seller Central to list one new product at a time.\n- Use Excel-based inventory files to add multiple product listings at once.\n- Use Amazon Marketplace Web Service to do bulk uploads and get bulk reports.\n\nHow will I know when I have a sale?\n\nAmazon notifies you by email or text message when you receive an order. You can choose either notification method in your account settings.\n\nHow much does it cost to ship items I sell?\n\nShipping fees depend on whether you plan to fulfill orders yourself, or use Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) to handle your logistics and customer service.\n\nLearn more about fulfillment costs\n\nHow does Fulfillment by Amazon work?\n\nWith Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) you store your products in Amazon's fulfillment centers, and we pick, pack, ship, and provide customer service for these products.\n\nLearn more about FBA\n\nWhat is the featured offer?\n\nThe featured offer (sometimes called the \"Buy Box\") is the place on a product detail page where customers start the purchase process by adding items to their shopping carts. A key feature of Amazon store is that the same product can be offered by several sellers.\n---\nhave multiple offers from multiple sellers. If more than one seller offers the same product in new condition, they can compete for the featured offer for that product.\n\nTo compete for featured offer placement, you must have a Professional seller account and demonstrate a consistently great buying experience for customers. Amazon uses performance-based criteria to determine featured offer eligibility and placement status. Eligible listings that do not win featured offer status are eligible for placement in the \"More Buying Choices\" box. Amazon does not guarantee placement in either of these locations.\n\nCan I offer gift-wrap and gift messaging services to my customers on Amazon.com?\n\nDefinitely! Our Gift Messaging service lets customers write notes for individual items or entire orders, and our Gift-Wrap service lets them select and pay for gift-wrapping for each item in their order.\n\nHow do I sell my products in other Amazon stores internationally, such as amazon.de and amazon.co.jp?\n\nSelling in other Amazon stores is similar to selling in the US. When you set up a Professional selling account in the US, you immediately have the option to list eligible products across North America (Canada and Mexico), Europe, Japan, Australia, and elsewhere. Learn more about how to sell in Amazon stores worldwide.\n\nHow do I sell books on Amazon?\n\nSelling books online can be a nice income stream—or the start of a profitable online business.

If you already have a seller account, login to Seller Central to see a list of your merged global accounts.\n\nWhat should I do if I do not have all the information to complete registration in a particular Amazon store?\n\nFor the registration process, you do not need store-specific information but only general information about your business. During registration, you can save your progress and login again to continue from where you left off. After registration is completed, you may need to provide additional information or documentation based on the countries in which you wish to sell in. For example, to sell in the United States, you are required to provide tax information after registration is completed.\n\nDo I have to sell in all stores?\n\nNo, even though you will have an account in each of the North American, European, Japan, and Australia stores, you can select the specific store(s) in which you want to sell for each product that you offer. You are not required to list products in all stores. If you want to list a product in a store for which you have a merged account already, you will not be required to go through the entire registration process again.\n---\n# I do not want to list my products in all the stores in Europe. Can I select the UK only (or Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Spain, etc.)?\n\nWhen you list your products in one of Amazon’s European stores, by default the listing will be available in all European stores, to make it easier for you to expand your business in Europe. If you wish to remove your listing from a specific store or opt out of this functionality altogether, you can login to Seller Central, go to Account Settings, and deselect the store(s).\n\n# I have completed the registration process, but I don’t need a seller account in all of the stores for which you have created merged accounts.

Please follow the instructions to switch to an Individual selling plan.\n\nTo close an account, login to the account for the store that you want to close, and go to Settings &gt; Account Info &gt; Close account in Seller Central. Please note that you must close each regional account individually (North America, Europe, Japan, Australia).\n\nIf you downgrade or close one of your accounts but still have buyable ASINs listed in your other merged accounts, you will still pay a Professional selling plan subscription fee. Ensure that you downgrade each merged account individually if you do not wish to be charged a monthly Professional subscription fee.\n\n# How do I sell in a store for which Amazon does not automatically create a merged account?\n\nRegister for that store separately. You can then merge that separate account to your Global Registration account.\n\n# Learn about selling in Amazon stores worldwide\n\n# Other Resources\n\n|Amazon Seller App|Amazon Seller Help|Amazon Seller Central|\n|---|---|---|\n|Manage your business from wherever you are.
